# Introduction
I chose to look at Premier Lacrosse League data for the year 2022 because it was a year that had full data and was pre-covid. I was able to create maps to show the home stadium locations of each of the teams in their home cities. Though this analysis I was able to look at lots of ingightful aspects able thte game of lacrosse and what makes a team champion material. 

# Future Work
In the future I would like to get into the new WLL that will be launching in 2025. As someone who has played lacrosse for most of my life and most recenly at the Division-one collegiate level This is something that really interests me and that I would love yo be apart of. There are so many valuable insights when looking into player and team statistics and need to be capatilized upon.
